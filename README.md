# P.T. for PC

![Lisa in the hallway](docs/media/lisa.gif)

If the port is worth something to you, you can buy me a coffee: [patreon.com/loreanxavier](https://www.patreon.com/loreanxavier). It keeps the testing hardware and the releases coming.

This is a native PC port of P.T., the 2014 PS4 teaser by Kojima Productions. It is not an emulator. The game logic was
rebuilt in C++ from the original's behaviour and the renderer is written on Vulkan; every level, model, texture, sound,
script and cutscene is read at run time from your own copy of the PS4 game. There is no game data in this repository
and none in the installer.

I made this in my spare time, with AI tools (see AI Disclosure at the end), because P.T. deserved to keep existing
somewhere other than on consoles that still have it installed. It plays the whole teaser from the first wake-up to
the street, with the voice part included.

## What you need

- Your own copy of P.T. The port is built and tested with the US release, CUSA01127, as a dump folder from your console
  or a fake PKG made from that dump. The European and Japanese releases install too, with a note, but I have not seen
  their data myself. A store PKG cannot be used: it is encrypted for the console that owns it, and nothing here
  decrypts it.
- Windows 10 or 11 (x64), Linux x86-64 with glibc 2.38 or newer (Ubuntu 24.04, Debian 13, Fedora 39, current Arch
  and SteamOS), or macOS 14 or newer on an Apple silicon Mac. The separate upstream Intel app still needs hardware testing.
- A GPU and driver with Vulkan 1.3; on macOS the port brings MoltenVK, which runs Vulkan on Metal. The optional
  ray-traced shadows, ambient occlusion and reflections need a GPU with Vulkan ray queries (not on macOS). DLSS needs a
  GeForce RTX card; FSR and XeSS run on any recent GPU (Windows only). The settings page greys out what your machine
  cannot run and says why.
- A microphone for one part of the game, as on the PS4. If you have none, `key = J` under `[voice]` in `pt.ini` lets a
  key stand in for the spoken word.

## Installing

Download the installer from the Releases page: `P.T.PC.Port.Setup.exe` on Windows, the Linux setup binary on Linux.
Point it at your dump folder or fake PKG and at a destination folder (the default on Windows is
`%LocalAppData%\Programs\P.T. PC Port`). It copies the three game archives it needs (`chunk1.psarc`,
`texture.qar`, `pathid_list_ps4.bin`) next to the port and makes a desktop shortcut if you want one. The shortcut
uses `icon0.png` from your own copy, the icon the PS4 shows for the game. This repository does not contain the
package or that image: the installer reads it from the PKG or dump you select. The eboot, modules and the rest of
`sce_sys` are not used.

Linux: `chmod +x` the setup and run it, from a terminal or from the file manager (it uses zenity or kdialog for its windows). The game needs only glibc and the system's Vulkan driver. On a Steam Deck
install from desktop mode and add `pt` as a non-Steam game; it runs on SteamOS as it is.

macOS (Apple Silicon): download **PT-Mac-Setup-arm64.zip** from the
[Mac preview release](https://github.com/ignusloki/pt-pc/releases/tag/macos-arm64-preview-4), unzip it and open
**P.T. Mac Setup.app**. Choose your PKG or decrypted game folder and a destination. Open **P.T..app** inside
**P.T. PC Port**, keeping **CUSA01127** beside it. The runtime and its dependencies are included.


Portable downloads: `P.T.PC.Port-portable-windows.zip` and `P.T.PC.Port-portable-linux.zip` hold the same files the
setups install. Unpack one anywhere you can write to, then either put your extracted `CUSA01127` folder next to `pt.exe`
(`pt` on Linux) or pick the folder when the game asks at the first start. The macOS app zips work the same way. Game
archives are never included; the setups also accept a fake PKG, the portable zips need the extracted folder.

Settings, saves, logs and caches live in `data/` beside the executable on Windows and Linux, so a whole game folder can
be moved or copied; an older profile is migrated once without overwriting newer files. On macOS they stay in
`~/Library/Application Support/pt-port/pt/`. The game checks GitHub Releases for a newer version at startup;
`[network] check_updates = 0` disables that check.

Thanks to ahm3texe for the Apple silicon port(even though he is an easy ragebaitted dumbass), totsu0jv for Czech translation, GrzybDev for Polish translation, and yewhochen for the Linux library-loading
and startup-focus fixes. Their contributions are incorporated here, with platform and release changes adapted for 1.0.2.

## Playing

Mouse and WASD, right mouse button to zoom, left button, Enter or E to interact, Esc for the pause menu, Alt+Enter for
fullscreen, F10 for the PC settings. Any gamepad works as the PS4 pad; the button prompts follow whatever you used
last (keyboard, PlayStation, Xbox or Switch). Vibration follows the original's patterns. The in-game options
(brightness, subtitles, camera inversion) are the original ones, and as on the PS4 the option screen and the preface
only play on a first start.

## What the port adds

Everything below is off or set to the original's behaviour by default. The PS4 look is the baseline; the extras are
there if you want them.

Display and image
- Windowed, borderless or exclusive fullscreen, with a selectable render resolution and v-sync on or off. Exclusive
  fullscreen lists supported display modes; borderless keeps the desktop window and can render at another selected size.
- Upscalers: AMD FSR 3.1, NVIDIA DLSS 4.5 (with a choice of model) Intel XeSS and Apple MetalFX on macOS, in the usual quality steps or a
  custom scale, plus native-resolution anti-aliasing (FSR native AA, DLAA).
- Frame generation: AMD FSR 3 on Radeon RX 5000 or newer, NVIDIA DLSS Frame Generation on RTX 40 or newer.
- Graphics presets Low, Medium, Original (PS4), High, Ultra and Custom. The individual controls cover shadow map size,
  ray-traced shadows (sharp like the original or soft), contact shadows, ray-traced ambient occlusion, ray-traced floor
  reflections, anisotropic filtering, enhanced textures (2x upscaled once from your own files with Real-ESRGAN, cached
  on disk), film grain, motion blur, depth of field, the original's lens flare ghosts and the curved lens with colour
  fringing. Each one can go back to the PS4 setting on its own.

Extras
- Photo mode (F7): pause, fly the camera, adjust focal length, focus, aperture, exposure and roll, choose an aspect
  crop and color filter, then save at native resolution or 4K (3840 pixels on the long edge) to Pictures/PT Photos.
- Free camera (F6).
- Loop browser: jump to any loop of the house once you have finished the game.
- Museum: the game's subliminal images, radio and voice lines with transcripts, photo pieces, cutscenes, models and
  unused content, as you reach them in play. Pan model exhibits with WASD or the left stick; orbit with arrows or the
  right stick.
- Controller feedback: Original vibration is the default. Enhanced adds supported trigger vibration and, on supported
  wired USB DualSense controllers on Windows, haptics from filtered Lisa cries. The optional controller speaker and
  its volume are separate from vibration; the main game and headphone mix continue unchanged. Physical controller
  output still needs hardware validation.
- Game+: the content a finished game unlocks.
- Speedrun timer with a split at every loop, real time and game time, personal bests, and a LiveSplit server
  connection (Control > Start TCP Server in LiveSplit).
- Third person view (experimental).
- Fast walk: enable it in PC settings > Extras, then hold either Shift key or the controller's bottom face button
  (Xbox A / PlayStation X) to walk 50% faster. Release for normal speed. Interactions and puzzle timers keep their
  original behaviour. See [docs/fast-walk.md](docs/fast-walk.md).
- VR through OpenXR (experimental: I have no headset, so it has only run against a simulated runtime). See
  docs/vr.md before trying it.

Languages
- The original's English, French, German, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese and Japanese, plus Turkish, Simplified Chinese,
  Arabic, Russian, Ukrainian, Czech and Polish added by the port: menus, the PC settings and all subtitle lines. Voice audio stays the
  original English, and the word the microphone listens for is always "Jack".

Mods
- A `mods` folder next to the executable can replace game files, textures and sounds, and run Lua scripts that react
  to game events. See docs/modding.md and docs/lua_api.md.

## Building from source

Apple Silicon macOS: an experimental native port and Cocoa installer build path are
available in [docs/macos.md](docs/macos.md). Run `python3 tools/macos/build.py` on a Mac
with the prerequisites listed there. This target still needs macOS compilation and
gameplay validation before it can be considered a working release.

Windows: Visual Studio 2022 Build Tools, LLVM (clang-cl), the Vulkan SDK, CMake 3.28 and Ninja. Then

    tools\build_pt.bat release

gives `build\release\pt.exe`. CMake fetches the dependencies (SDL3, zlib, volk, VMA, glm, Dear ImGui, stb, Lua 5.1,
libogg, libvorbis, whisper.cpp) and downloads the Whisper and Silero models and the upscaler SDK files, each checked by
SHA-256. A failed SDK download leaves that upscaler out; `-DPT_UPSCALERS=OFF` builds without any. `python
tools\package.py` turns the build into the portable folder and zip.

Linux: `cmake -G Ninja -B build/linux -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo && cmake --build build/linux --target pt`.
GCC 13 or clang 17, the Vulkan headers and `glslc`. The upscalers are Windows-only SDKs and are left out there.
`tools/linux/` has the cross build I use from Windows. More in docs/linux.md.

macOS (Apple silicon or Intel, built for the CPU it runs on): the command line tools, then `brew install cmake ninja shaderc
vulkan-headers vulkan-loader` and `cmake -G Ninja -B build/macos -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo && cmake --build
build/macos --target pt`. `python3 tools/macos/make_app.py` makes the app bundle and its zip. The upscalers and the VR mode
are left out there too, and MoltenVK has no ray queries. More in docs/macos.md.

The unit tests are CMake targets (`pt_tests`, `pt_mods_test` and the others in CMakeLists.txt). `python
tools/walkthrough.py --exe build/release/pt.exe --game <folder>` plays the whole game without a window through the
scripted routes in `tests/walkthrough/` and checks the log; it is how I make sure a change did not break a loop.

The installer is `installer/`: a native C++ setup (`pt_setup`, built when a payload exists) and a small LGPL extraction
helper in C# that reads fake PKGs with LibOrbisPkg. docs/installer.md describes how it decides what it accepts.

Other docs: docs/upscaling.md, docs/vr.md, docs/updates.md, and the file format notes in docs/formats/ that came out of
reverse engineering the game data, with the tools in tools/ that read those formats.

## Thanks

P.T. is the work of Kojima Productions and is owned by Konami. This project is not affiliated with, endorsed by or
connected to either of them. It contains none of their assets and does nothing without your own copy of the game.

The shadPS4 emulator was my reference for how the original behaves on the PS4 and for checking the port's frames
against it. Thanks to its developers.

The port is built on SDL3, Vulkan (volk, VMA), glm, Dear ImGui, stb, Lua 5.1, libogg and libvorbis, whisper.cpp with
OpenAI's Whisper model and the Silero VAD for the voice part, Real-ESRGAN with ncnn for the enhanced textures, AMD
FidelityFX, NVIDIA DLSS and Intel XeSS for the upscalers, the Khronos OpenXR loader for VR, HarfBuzz on Linux and the
Noto fonts for the added languages, and LibOrbisPkg in the installer. Their notices ship in `licenses/` next to the
executable.

## License

The port's own code is under the MIT license (see LICENSE). The third-party pieces listed above keep their own
licenses.

## AI Disclosure

AI coding tools were used in developing and debugging this port. My focus has been on matching the original P.T.:
comparing builds with PS4 references, identifying discrepancies, testing gameplay and prioritizing fixes.

The project uses the original game assets from the player's own PS4 copy. Optional enhanced textures use
machine-learning upscaling on existing textures.
