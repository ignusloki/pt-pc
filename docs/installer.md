# Installer

The release is an installer that builds a working P.T. folder from the player's own copy of the game. It ships the PC
runtime (pt.exe, shaders, fonts, voice model, upscaler DLLs, licenses) and no Konami asset: the three game archives are
taken from what the player selects, on the player's PC.

## Pieces

Apple Silicon macOS uses `installer/Native/setup_macos.mm` (Cocoa), a self-contained
`osx-arm64` extractor, and a game `.app` containing MoltenVK. The hashed `PTSETUP1`
payload is a bundle resource, so executable code signing is preserved. Build and
acceptance instructions are in [macos.md](macos.md); Mac runtime validation is pending.

| Piece | Source | Language | Role |
|---|---|---|---|
| `pt_setup.exe` (shipped as `P.T.PC.Port.Setup.exe`) | `installer/Native/setup.cpp`, CMake target `pt_setup` | C++20, Win32 API | the installer: window, checks, payload unpack, install |
| `PT.PkgExtract.exe` | `installer/Extractor/Program.cs` | C#, .NET 10 self-contained, LGPL-3.0-or-later | reads a fake PKG with LibOrbisPkg and writes the three archives |
| LibOrbisPkg | upstream `maxton/LibOrbisPkg`, patched by `tools/patch_liborbis_readers.py` | C#, LGPL | PKG and PFS reader used by the helper |
| extractor tests | `installer/Tests/Program.cs` | C# | builds a synthetic fake PKG with LibOrbisPkg and checks extraction, refusals |

The extraction helper is a separate executable on purpose: it is LGPL, so it stays a replaceable program next to the
setup, and its corresponding source (patched LibOrbisPkg plus the wrapper) goes into the payload as
`extractor/LibOrbisPkg-corresponding-source.zip` with `extractor/LICENSE-LibOrbisPkg.txt`.

## How a release is built

`tools/ci/release.py --dest C:\Projects\pt-port-rt-releases --out <dir> --version 1.0.0` builds the release. `--name`
fixes the folder under `--dest` (default: a date and time stamp).

The setup's window title and product name are "P.T. PC Port", the default folder `%LocalAppData%\Programs\P.T. PC Port`,
with a plain desktop shortcut. It checks its own integrity stamp (see Integrity below).

Every installation uses `data/` next to the game executable for settings, saves, logs, crash dumps and generated caches; there is no separate portable mode. Fresh installs create and test this writable directory. Updates test the existing directory before swapping program files and preserve its contents, even if an older manifest incorrectly lists `data/*`. Payloads cannot ship files under `data/`. The game's first normal launch imports missing legacy profile data without deleting the source, and records completion so reset progress is not imported again.

Windows Release/RelWithDebInfo compilation requires FSR, DLSS and XeSS. SDK download/hash failures stop configuration instead of silently compiling a reduced executable. Required DLLs are build dependencies, so rebuilding restores missing copies without needing to relink. Executable manifests include the compiled backends and executable SHA-256; packaging checks them and also requires every Streamline runtime file when Frame Generation was compiled. The native Windows installer checks the three upscaler DLL entries before publishing the installation. Linux keeps its current SDK limitations.

1. sets `PT_VERSION` (written into `build/release/generated/pt_version.h` at every build by `cmake/version.cmake`; the
   game, the setup and the update check read it);
2. builds `pt` and `pt_release` through the machine-wide limiter `C:/Projects/pt-port/shared/ptslot.py` (4 jobs), and
   checks that the build took the version;
3. `tools/package.py` makes the portable folder and zip (`game/` from pt_release.exe, which ships as pt.exe), carrying
   the executable's upscaler build manifest when present; release packaging requires all three upscalers;
4. copies the LibOrbisPkg source (`--liborbis`, else the first `LibOrbisPkg*` folder under `dump/` of this repository,
   `C:\Projects\pt-port-rt\dump` or `C:\Projects\pt-port\dump`, one or two levels down) into `build/release/liborbis-src`,
   retargets it to net10.0 and applies `tools/patch_liborbis_readers.py` (PFSC blocks read with `ReadExactly`, chunked
   memory-mapped reads use the current chunk length); the original is never changed;
5. publishes the helper from that copy (`dotnet publish installer/Extractor -c Release -r win-x64 --self-contained true`)
   into `build/release/extractor-win`. Nothing prebuilt is used: `installer/*/bin` and `obj` are not in git;
6. `tools/prepare_native_installer.py` writes `dump/installer-20261002/native/payload.bin` from that zip and the helper.
   It verifies the Windows executable's build manifest and upscaler DLLs, and refuses a runtime zip with a `game`,
   `CUSA01127` or `enhanced-textures` folder in it, so game data cannot slip into a release;
7. CMake defines `pt_setup` only when that payload exists, so the script reconfigures (which also applies the version)
   and builds it; the payload goes in as Windows resource 100 (`installer/Native/setup.rc.in`, which also carries the
   version and product name);
8. `tools/ci/stamp_integrity.py` writes the SHA-256 of the setup into the setup itself (see Integrity);
9. with `--linux-setup <name>`, makes the Linux setup as `<name>` in the same folder (see Linux below);
The game and installers discover updates through the GitHub Releases API (docs/updates.md); no separate update JSON
file is uploaded with the platform packages.

`release.json` lists the version, the LibOrbisPkg source used, every step's exit code and the files.

The payload is `PTSETUP1`, a u32 file count, then per file: u16 name length, UTF-8 name, u64 size, u64 packed size,
64 hex chars of SHA-256, zlib data. At install every file is unpacked, written and hashed again; a wrong hash, a path
with `..`, a drive letter or `:` stops the install.

## What the player gives it

The setup takes one input, a file or a folder (the `PKG...` and `Folder...` buttons fill the same field). Every input
format below already holds decrypted game files; setup and helper never decrypt Sony-encrypted content.

Policy: refuse as little as possible. There are exactly two refusals:
1. an encrypted PKG the helper cannot open (a store PKG, or a damaged one);
2. input that is not P.T.

Every release and version of P.T. installs. What differs from the tested US data is installed anyway, written to
`install-notes.txt` in the install folder and to `CUSA01127/source.txt`, and logged by the game at start (`data:` lines).

| Input | Result | How it is read |
|---|---|---|
| fake PKG (fPKG) of any P.T. release | installs | helper: PKG magic `7F 43 4E 54`, the PFS key opens with LibOrbisPkg's fake-package keyset, the inner PFSC image is searched for the archives |
| game folder dumped from the player's console (`CUSA01127`, `CUSA01114-app`, a dumper's output folder) | installs | setup copies the archives, found by their headers |
| an fPKG extracted to a folder, or an emulator's install folder (shadPS4 writes `CUSA01127/` with the archives at its root) | installs | as a dump folder |
| a folder that holds no archives but exactly one PKG (for example `user/app/CUSA01127/` copied off a console) | the PKG is used | as a PKG |
| EU (CUSA01114), JP (CUSA01098) or an unknown P.T. title ID | installs, with a note | see Releases below |
| archives under other names or in a subfolder of the PKG | installs, with a note | found by content and written under the names the port reads |
| no `pathid_list_ps4.bin` | installs, with a note | only enhanced texture generation needs it |
| store (retail) PKG | refused (1) | message: dump P.T. from your own PS4 and select the dump folder or an fPKG made from it |
| an update or add-on PKG, another game, an encrypted folder copy | refused (2) | message: no P.T. game data here |

### How P.T. is recognised

By content, not by title ID alone:
- a PSARC (`PSAR` magic) and a QAR (`aq` at offset 0x16 of the last 0x24 bytes): `chunk1.psarc` and `texture.qar` when those
  names exist, else the largest valid `.psarc` / `.qar` (in the PKG: anywhere outside `sce_sys` and `sce_module`; in a folder:
  that folder);
- and P.T.'s level names (`pt14_`) in the path list (`pathid_list_ps4.bin`, else a file whose name contains `pathid_list`),
  or a known P.T. title ID (CUSA01127, CUSA01114, CUSA01098). A folder with neither a path list nor a title ID (an extracted
  fPKG without `sce_sys`) installs with a note that it could not be confirmed.

The title ID comes from the PKG content ID, or a folder's `sce_sys/param.sfo` (`TITLE_ID`). Folders are searched from the
selected folder down two levels (not `sce_sys` or `sce_module`); selecting a single archive means its folder. An
encrypted copy (files taken off a console disk without decryption) has no valid header, so nothing is found.

There is no whole-file hash check. The legacy WinForms setup compared SHA-256 with one local dump
(`installer/Setup/archive-manifest.json`); the native setup does not, so a correct dump made by another tool, or another
release, is not refused for differing bytes. `tools/installer_pkg_check.py` compares a real PKG install against a
known-good local dump as a test, never as an install condition.

### Releases

| Title ID | Release | Status |
|---|---|---|
| CUSA01127 | US | the data the port is built and tested with (`chunk1.psarc` f3cf67ef..., `texture.qar` 436bb79d..., `pathid_list_ps4.bin` 6b4641ba...) |
| CUSA01114 | Europe | installs with a note; archive bytes not yet seen |
| CUSA01098 | Japan | installs with a note; archive bytes not yet seen |

What is known about the differences:
- The US `chunk1.psarc` already holds all seven subtitle languages (`as/sh/level/ui/subtitles/EngVoice/{Eng,Fre,Ger,Ita,
  Jpn,Por,Spa}Text/`), English voice only. The European store page lists the same seven text languages, so the EU and JP
  releases are expected to carry the same set; that is not yet verified against their data.
- Differences the installer handles: the title ID and content ID, archive names and locations.
- Differences the game handles: at start it logs `source.txt` and names any of twelve core packages (resident, the six
  stages, player motion and parts, UI data and language, English subtitles) missing from this copy's `chunk1.psarc`; a
  subtitle language missing from the copy falls back to English with a warning (`SubtitleTable::Load`).
- Not handled yet, if a release turns out to differ there: other internal paths, a different `texture.qar` layout, other
  file formats. The install goes ahead and the game logs what it cannot load.

Whoever has an EU or JP dump can help: install it, then send `install-notes.txt` and the `data:` lines of `pt.log`.

### Why only fake PKGs and dumps

A store PKG is encrypted for the console that holds its license. Opening one needs that console's keys, which is DRM
circumvention, and neither the setup nor the helper does it. A fake PKG is the homebrew package format: tools rebuild it
from a dump and encrypt its PFS with a publicly known fake keyset, which LibOrbisPkg uses to read it back. When players
say a non-fPKG "converts to fPKG easily", the step that makes it possible is the dump on their own jailbroken console
(the console decrypts its licensed copy); the conversion after that is repackaging. Without that console the conversion
needs the console's keys, which this project does not use. P.T. was delisted in 2015, so in practice the source is a
console that still has it installed.

## What it installs

1. The destination is checked: no junctions or symbolic links in it or above it. An empty name or a folder that holds
   something else is refused; an existing P.T. port install is updated in place (next section).
2. The setup's own file is checked (see Integrity) before anything is written; at least 3 GB free (1 GB for an update
   that keeps the game archives).
3. A staging folder `.pt-install-<id>` next to the destination receives the payload (runtime and helper).
4. The game archives go to `staging/CUSA01127/`: the helper extracts them from a PKG, or setup copies them from a folder.
   Only `chunk1.psarc`, `texture.qar` and `pathid_list_ps4.bin` are written, under these names whatever the release calls
   them, plus `source.txt` (title ID, region, notes); the eboot, `sce_sys` and modules are not used by the port. Only
   these fixed names are written, so names inside a PKG cannot escape the folder. Notes go to `install-notes.txt`.
5. `pt-install-manifest.txt` is written: `pt-port-install 1`, `version=<PT_VERSION>`, then `file=<sha256> <path>` for every
   program file (everything the payload wrote; not the game archives, notes or anything the player adds).
6. The staging folder is renamed to the destination and the optional desktop shortcut made. On any error or cancel only
   that staging folder is removed.

pt.exe finds the data without `--game`: `game/CUSA01127` or `CUSA01127` next to it or up to four folders above, then the
folder remembered in the user data folder, then (windowed runs) a folder picker.

### Progress

The install is measured in bytes (`Progress` in `setup_core.h`). The total is fixed before the first byte is written:
what the payload unpacks to (its headers, `PayloadBytes`) plus the game archives (a dump folder's file sizes; a PKG
counts as its own size, the helper's output files are polled against it while it runs and the phase is completed when
the helper ends). The payload is written in 4 MB pieces and the archives copied in 4 MB pieces, each one counted, so
the percentage only rises. The status line names the step (`Extracting shaders... 43%`). Steps before the total is known
(reading the input, the setup's own integrity check) show a marquee.

On Windows the worker thread never touches a window: it posts the status text, the progress (permille, posted only when
it changes) and the result to the window, which sets `PBM_SETPOS` and the label. The progress bar needs Common Controls
6, so `installer/Native/setup.manifest` (the dependency, `asInvoker`, per-monitor DPI) goes in as the manifest resource
and the linker is told not to make one (`/MANIFEST:NO`); without it the classic control draws no marquee at all. The
Linux setup prints the same line to the terminal, rewritten in place with `\r`.

## Updating an install

When the chosen folder holds a P.T. port install, the setup asks first: "P.T. is already installed here (version X).
Update it to version Y?", or, for the same version, "already installed here and up to date. Repair it?". An install is
recognised by its manifest, or, for installs made before the manifest existed, by `pt.exe` (or `pt` on Linux) together
with `CUSA01127/chunk1.psarc` and `CUSA01127/texture.qar`. Any other folder stays refused.

The update (`RunInstall` and `SwapProgramFiles` in `setup_core.h`):
- unpacks the new program files into `.pt-update-<id>` next to the install and checks each one's SHA-256;
- keeps the game archives when `chunk1.psarc` (PSAR header) and `texture.qar` (QAR footer) pass their check; otherwise the
  PKG or dump folder field must name the game again, and the archives are restored from it (with new notes);
- moves each new file into place by rename, the file it replaces first into `.pt-update-old-<id>`;
- removes the program files the new version no longer ships into that backup too: those listed in the old manifest, or,
  for an install without one, only names the setup itself ships (`pt.exe`, the three upscaler DLLs, `README-UPDATE.txt`,
  `manifest.json`, `shaders/*.spv`, `extractor/*`, and the old voice
  recognizer's `voice/cmudict-en-us.dict`, `voice/en-us/*` and `voice/vosk/*`). Unknown files stay;
- writes the new manifest as part of the same swap;
- keeps everything else: the complete `data/` folder, mods, logs, enhanced textures,
  anything added by hand;
- on any failure (a file in use because P.T. is running, a full disk, cancel) moves every file back in reverse order,
  so the install is exactly as before, and says "Nothing was changed"; then deletes its staging and backup folders.

A repair is the same run with the same version: all program files are rewritten from the setup and the archives checked.

Command line, used by tests: `pt_setup.exe --install <pkg or folder, or "" to keep the archives> <folder> <result file>`
(a new folder installs, an install is updated without asking; the result file says `PASS installed` or `PASS updated`
with the counts, then a `progress events N monotonic yes distinct D last 100%` line: every progress call counted, never
lower than the one before, D of the 1001 permille values reached), `--verify-integrity <result file>`, `--check-update <result file>`, `--self-test <result file>` (path
containment, input formats, update manifest, and the in-place update on synthetic installs with and without
a manifest: new files in place, obsolete ones removed, player files kept, rollback after a failure at three different
steps), `--preview <bmp>` (draws the window to a file without showing it). The setup window and pt.exe both show the
version (the setup in its header line, the game in the PC settings corner line and at the top of pt.log).

## Integrity

The setup checks its own file against a corrupt or truncated download: it reads the file back and compares a SHA-256
written into it after the build (`src/engine/platform/self_integrity.h`, `tools/ci/stamp_integrity.py`; the Linux setup is
stamped by `tools/linux/attach_payload.py`). An unstamped or damaged setup refuses to install and asks for a new download.
The game does not check its own file.

## Tools

- `tools/pkginfo.py <pkg> [--extract DIR]`: prints a PKG's header, entry table, PFS header and param.sfo, and writes the
  plaintext `sce_sys` entries. Useful to tell a fake PKG from a store PKG and to read the content ID.
- `tools/installer_pkg_check.py --installer <setup> --pkg <pkg> --reference <dump> --out <new dir>`: installs a real PKG and
  compares the three archives with a local dump, then starts the installed game headless for 200 frames.
- `installer/Tests`: `dotnet run -c Release -p:LibOrbisSource=<LibOrbisPkg> -- <new dir> [<dump folder>]` builds fake PKGs
  (synthetic, or from a dump's archives) and checks exact extraction without notes (US), refusal of an existing output and
  of an invalid file, EU and JP content IDs installed with a note, archives renamed into a subfolder found by content, an
  unknown title with P.T.'s content installed, another game refused, and a store PKG (entry keys that the fake keyset
  cannot open) refused with the dump message.

## Linux

The installer is C++ for Windows (`setup.cpp`, Win32 window) and Linux (`setup_linux.cpp`); what they share is
`installer/Native/setup_core.h` (input formats, P.T. recognition, archive copy, notes, payload format, path checks). The
extraction helper is C#/.NET 10 and publishes for Linux unchanged (`dotnet publish installer/Extractor -c Release
-r linux-x64 --self-contained true -p:LibOrbisSource=<LibOrbisPkg>`).

`pt_setup_linux` (CMake target outside Windows) runs from a terminal (asks for the PKG or folder and the new folder,
default `~/.local/share/pt-pc-port`), or with zenity file pickers when started without a terminal; the command line
options are those of the Windows setup. It installs a menu entry in `~/.local/share/applications`, sets the execute bits
the payload does not store, and checks its own integrity stamp as the Windows setup does (the Linux branch of
`self_integrity.h`: a built-in SHA-256 and `/proc/self/exe`). `release.py --linux-setup <name>` makes it after the
Windows setup, in the same version (`--linux-only --name <folder>` makes only it, from the Windows package a previous
run left there):

1. `tools/linux/cross_build.sh` builds `pt` (its post build steps bring the fonts, shaders and voice runtime), the game
   (`pt_release`) and `pt_setup_linux` in `build/linux-cross` (the sysroot from `PT_LINUX_SYSROOT` or `--linux-sysroot`,
   docs/linux.md);
2. `tools/package.py --build build/linux-cross` makes the portable zip under `<folder>/linux/runtime`; the Linux game
   cannot shoot the loop browser previews on Windows, so the ones the Windows package shot are copied in and the zip is
   written again;
3. the helper is published for linux-x64 into `build/release/extractor-linux` from the same patched LibOrbisPkg copy;
4. `tools/prepare_native_installer.py --out <folder>/linux/payload` writes the payload from that zip and helper;
5. `tools/linux/attach_payload.py` appends the payload to `pt_setup_linux` (payload, `PTPAYLD1`, u64 offset, u64 size)
   and stamps the file (tools/ci/stamp_integrity.py) as `<folder>/<name>`.

By hand, the same three tools:

    python tools/package.py --build build/linux-cross --exe build/linux-cross/pt_release --out <dir>/runtime
    python tools/prepare_native_installer.py --release --runtime <dir>/runtime/<zip> --extractor <linux helper> --source <LibOrbisPkg> --out <dir>/payload
    python tools/linux/attach_payload.py --setup build/linux-cross/pt_setup_linux --payload <dir>/payload/payload.bin --out <dir>/P.T.PC.Port.Setup-linux

Checks on Linux or WSL: docs/linux.md (`run_tests.sh`), and the release 1.0.0 notes below.

## Update check

Both setups look for a newer release when they start (docs/updates.md) and show it without blocking anything.

For 1.0.2 only, add `--legacy-update-manifest` to the release command. This creates the final remote `latest.json` asset for existing 1.0.1 update notifications. Do not pass it for 1.0.3 or later; those releases publish platform packages only.
